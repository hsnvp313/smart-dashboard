## 🌐 API Integration

### Products API

This project uses the **Fake Store API** to simulate real-world product data.

```
https://fakestoreapi.com/products
```

- Data fetched using `fetch`
- Managed with `useEffect` and `useState`
- Includes loading and error handling for better UX

### Orders Data

- Orders are implemented using **mock data**
- This is intentional, as real order systems usually require authentication and user context
- Focus is kept on UI behavior and state management
